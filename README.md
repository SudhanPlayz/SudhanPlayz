## Hi, Iâ€™m Sudhan ðŸ‘‹ <img align="right" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55418697?v=4" width="200" />
I'm a full-stack and blockchain developer from India with a passion for building scalable web apps, games, and smart contract systems. Iâ€™ve been actively working in the dev space for over 5 years, shipping projects that span DeFi, NFTs, bots, and AI-powered tools.

I specialize in technologies like TypeScript, Next.js, Express, Prisma, and Node.js on the backend â€” and I'm equally comfortable writing Solidity or deploying on Solana using Rust and Anchor. I've built Discord bots, Telegram mini-apps, and AI agents that interact with blockchain protocols in natural language.

Hackathons have been a huge part of my journey â€” I've won ETHIndia (twice) and Unfold, and I love prototyping bold ideas fast. Whether it's creating decentralized games, automating DeFi operations, or building dev tools, Iâ€™m always exploring whatâ€™s next.

Some of my open-source projects are pinned below â€” feel free to dive in and reach out if you want to collaborate!

Thanks for stopping by ðŸŒ±
