## Hi, Iâ€™m Sudhan ðŸ‘‹ <img align="right" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55418697?v=4" width="200" />
i'm a full stack and blockchain dev from india. i love building cool stuff like web apps, games, smart contracts and bots. been in the dev space for 5+ years working on everything from defi and nfts to ai tools and automation.

i work a lot with typescript, nextjs, express, prisma and node on the backend. also super comfortable with solidity and solana dev using rust and anchor. i've made discord bots, telegram mini apps and ai agents that talk to blockchain in plain english.

hackathons are a big part of my story. won ethindia twice and unfold once. i enjoy building fast, testing ideas and shipping weird stuff that actually works.

some of my open source projects are down below if you wanna check them out. always open to collab or jam on something fun.

thanks for dropping by ðŸŒ±
