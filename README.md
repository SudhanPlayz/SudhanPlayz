## Hi there 👋 <img align="right" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55418697?v=4" width="200" />
I'm **Sudhan**, a developer from India. I like to code web applications and games. I have worked on many projects in my past, and some of my open-source projects are pinned below—make sure to check them out.

I work with various technologies, including TypeScript, JavaScript, API development, both backend and frontend. I use Prisma and Express for backend development and Next.js with TypeScript for full-stack applications. 

Additionally, I have experience with Discord bot development, Blockchain, Web3, and DApps, always trying to stay updated with new technologies.

Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile. Have a great day ahead!~
